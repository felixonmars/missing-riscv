File-and-directory based analysis of Arch Linux packages.

This repository contains `tree` output of generated src directories of Arch Linux packages, which contains `arm64` or `aarch64`, but not `riscv`.

This provides an overview of Linux packages that are available for ARM but **maybe** not for RISC-V.

False-positives and not-applicable packages are expected.
